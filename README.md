# TestFairy Connect 

## How does it work?

TestFairy Connect is designed to help developers integrate their bug tracking systems running behind firewall with their 
TestFairy account.

The key part of TestFairy Connect is the agent service (TFC Agent) that runs on a system also behind firewall, connecting both TestFairy's web app and bug tracking system.
